# Greenlight
JSON API for retrieving and managing information about movies.

Taken from https://github.com/flaviogalon/greenlight/tree/main for testing purposes.



This is an educational project developed following the book [Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards

## My twist
- I'll use SQLite as the DB instead of PostgreSQL (which is the author's choice)
- I'll use Go's router (ServeMux) taking advantages of the improvements made on v1.22

## Endpoints
